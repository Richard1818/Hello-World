# Hello-World
The beginning of the end. 
Hello World!  This is the first step in another journey towards my final or next destination.  This time is always filled with an excitement of the freshly viewed vision in all of its glory and the dread of the endless menial tasks it takes to make it barely recognizeable compared to the beauty and innocence of the original masterpiece.  This will be another attempt at conveying the unimaginable in a format that is archaic and unable to expound the graphic and miniscule details that may determine the success or failure of the result.
